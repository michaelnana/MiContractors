We think of the 3 pillars of our foundation...\r\n\r\nOne...We are dedicated to providing homeowners with complete home energy saving solutions. When we say “COMPLETE”, WE MEAN IT! Most companies sell solely based on what they can offer. We believe that much like a doctor, every home needs to be diagnosed based on their own deficiencies.\r\n\r\nTwo...We offer a better line of products and services, all across the board! While the majority of companies offer products that insider’s call “builder grade”. Essentially a “cheaper” line of product, made to the masses. We have aligned ourselves with companies such as; York – an industry leader in HVAC, and Vinyl Guard – who offer a LIFETIME GUARANTEE on their windows and doors... Just to name a few. \r\n\r\nThree...We do it right! Our technicians know that our mission is to treat YOUR home better that our own. All of our installations are done by an Authorized, Licensed, Green Authority Technician. By not outsourcing the installation process, we can make sure that quality control is top notch.\r\n\r\nIn a free, one hour, in home consultation, one of our Efficiency Advisors can offer great solutions in making your home energy efficient.

While there is plenty of information available on the internet that might allow for you to embark on a do-it-yourself project you will want a qualified professional to do the job so you don't encounter any issues later on. The process of installing an air conditioner onto your HVAC system is a very labor intensive and involved process that requires someone who has experience in the field.\r\nInstallation of an air conditioning unit requires a lot of different tasks to be completed. Electrical work is involved as well as plumbing work. Neither of these are easy to do unless you know what you are doing and if you slip up with either during installation it can cost you a lot of money to fix. You are installing something onto your HVAC system and you don't want to cause damage to your furnace as well. When dealing with the moisture that needs to be properly removed from the air conditioning unit you will want to ensure that moisture goes where it needs to instead of damaging your home or the air conditioning unit.\r\n\r\nHEATING SYSTEM INSTALLATION AND REPAIR\r\nHiring a professional plumber for installing or replacing a furnace is recommended rather than DIY. This is because there are many things that can be overlooked by the typical lay person. A trained specialist knows exactly what to look for and how to spot potential problems before they arise. Professionals have been through the proper training and installed numerous furnaces on a daily basis.The experience alone is worth the money spent to hire a well trained professional. Someone who installs furnaces on a regular basis is familiar with a variety of different brands of furnaces and has had experience installing each unique brand. By installing or replacing the furnace yourself, you could damage part of the unit and it usually isn't covered by a warranty. With a specialist installing the furnace, should anything damage the unit, the warranty is still effective.\r\n",
