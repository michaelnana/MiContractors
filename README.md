<h1>Welcome to MiContractors</h1>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>This is an assignment that uses mock data to display companies and lets you view each company in their own view.</p>
<p>For a live demo, go to <a href="https://mi-contractors.herokuapp.com">https://mi-contractors.herokuapp.com</a> to see this in action. </p>
<p>If you want to run this locally, make sure you have node.js installed and simple run <u>node server.js</u> in the project root.</p>
<h4>Have fun!</h4>
